\section{Paper size and format}
\textbf{Only PDF files} are acceptable. Each paper size should be
A4 (21.0cm$\times$29.7cm) and the following margins should be set:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
    Left margin  &  20mm \\
    Right margin &  20mm \\
    Top margin   &  25mm \\
    Bottom margin&  25mm \\
    Column width &  80mm \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Fonts and style}

\subsection{First part}
The first part includes the paper title, authors' name, abstract,
and keywords. All fonts must be in Times New Roman, and the font
size of the title, authors' name, affiliation, abstract, and
keywords are bold 12pt, 11pt, 10pt, 10pt, and 10pt, respectively.

\subsection{Paper body}
The second part consisting of the paper body must be edited in the
double column format, with each column 80mm width and separated by
10mm. The top-level heading, usually called section, numbered in
Arabic numerals, shall appear centered on the column with Times New
Roman capital bold 11pt. The numbered level-two heading starts from
the left in Times New Roman bold 10pt font. The main text uses Times
New Roman 10pt font with single spacing. New paragraphs indent 4mm
on the first line.

\section{Figures, tables, and equations}

\subsection{Figures and tables}
All figures and tables should be placed after their first mention in the text. Large
figures and tables may span across both columns. Scanned images (e.g., line art, photos)
can be used if the output resolution is at least 600 dpi.

\begin{figure}[thb]
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[height=3cm]{test.eps}
\includegraphics[height=3cm]{test.eps}
\caption{\label{test}The caption should be placed after the figure.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure captions should be below the figures; table captions should be above the tables.
They should be referred to in the text as, for example, Fig. \ref{test}, or Figs.
1$\sim$3.
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{The caption should be placed before the table.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    &   A   &   B   &   C \\\hline
(1) & 150\% & 16.3\% & 18.2\% \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Equations}
Equation numbers should be Arabic numerals enclosed in parentheses
on the right-hand margin. They should be cited in the text as, for
example, Eq. (1), or Eqs. (1) $\sim$ (3). Equations start from the
left on the column. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when
they are part of a sentence. For example,
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x}&=& Ax+bu, \\
y &=& Cx+Du.
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{References} References should appear in a separate
bibliography at the end of the paper, with items referred to by
numerals in square brackets [1, 4-5]. Times New Roman 10pt is used
for references.
%\cite{ref1}. Times New Roman 10pt is used for references.

\section{Page Numbers}
Do not put a page number in the manuscript PDF.
