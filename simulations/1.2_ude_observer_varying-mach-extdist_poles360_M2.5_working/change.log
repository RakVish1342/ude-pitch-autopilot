Mdot_exp.m deleted; M=3 uncommented; Added "global M" to a_exp.m and b_exp.m
disturbance.m deleted
ext_dist.m deleted
fil_exp.m removed
removed unecessary global vars


Set observer poles: l1,l2,l3

Reference - xcaps == nucap --> +uacap, +dcap --> gives u --> A,B (plant == alphatripdot == a_exp and b_exp)
                                                        |
                                                         --> Acap, Bcap ( alphatripdotcap == a_exp_cap/obs_a_exp and b_exp_cap/obs_b_exp)
                        
Replicate controller blocks for observer; rename funcs and variable in observer blocks
Make all controller blocks take input from output of observer block

Move the disturbance block to upper section to ensure it stays in the REAL portion of the simulink block
Check all block's function names and ensure that they have been changed/retained as necessary
